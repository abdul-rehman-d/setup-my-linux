# Setup my Linux
This is a collection of scripts that I am maintaining which transform a fresh install of `Debian` or Debian-based Linux distributions into my desired setup.

# Tools it installs
- git
- zsh (with [OhMyZsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) & [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/) )
- Docker

# Limitations
- Docker installation required that you are running `bookworm` version of Debian or similarly Debian-based distribution.
